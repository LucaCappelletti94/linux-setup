# Preliminary utilities

In this section I will list the utilities I install on a fresh Linux system. This is not a complete list, but rather a list of the utilities I will assume as available in the rest of the documentation.

```bash
sudo apt update
sudo apt -y install curl git cmake clang libssl-dev mold
```
