# Linux Setup

Setting up my linux server primarely for Rust coding and running a few services.

## Installing the Linux system

In some occasions, even installing the Linux system can be a bit tricky. [I list the errors and hickups I have encountered here](INSTALLATION.md).

## Preliminary utilities

In [this section](PRELIMINARY.md) I will list the utilities I install on a fresh Linux system. This is not a complete list, but rather a list of the utilities I will assume as available in the rest of the documentation.

## Rust

I will use Rust for most of my coding. [Here](RUST.md) I will list the steps I take to install Rust and the utilities I use.
